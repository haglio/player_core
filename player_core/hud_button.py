"""A button a content source declares on a player's HUD.

The source says what each button posts, what face it wears and what state it is
in; the player lays the buttons out, draws them and posts the declared verb.
The record and its published form live together so a source in another
process (Fun Time, writing the HUD files) and one in the player's own (a hosted
Origenerator) spell a button the same way.

    """One item on a HUD: what it posts, what it looks like, how it is drawn.

    ``lit``, ``warn`` and ``hold`` are the live states — the family's blue for
    on, red for a live recording, blue for the loop that recording leaves
    running.  ``favorite`` names a control whose on-state is green (the
    favorites and the funscripts own that color); ``enhanced`` one whose mark
    and on-state are amber (an enhanced picture's own).  ``dim`` is a control
    at the end of its range or with nothing to act on: drawn faded and never a
    hit target.  ``danger`` draws the mark red — a control that takes something
    away.  ``remembered`` is a choice held but not applied, on the active gray.
    ``group_break`` opens the wider gap before this button.

    An empty ``command`` makes it a read-out: laid out in the row like anything
    else, drawn as bare text with no button, and never a hit target.  A read-out
    whose number only the drawing host knows names it in ``host_value``
    ("playback_speed", "advance_interval") and the painter fills it in.
