"""Which clip is up: the step, the switch and what is deferred between them.

A step to a clip that is already decoded switches at once; a step to one that
is not keeps the current clip playing and takes the new one up when its decode
lands, so the screen never goes blank waiting.  A condemned clip's successor and
a reordered folder's head are the two switches that are never deferred, because
in both the point is to see the new clip now.
