"""What the device is about to be asked to do, and by whom — the trace's model.

The line is four things in a row, and nothing else:

    whatever Genau is doing
    a ramp from where that leaves the device down onto the park
    whatever the funscript is doing
    a ramp back up to where Genau's stroke begins

Green is the script scripting, blue is Genau stroking, gray is a ramp or the
rest between them — nobody drives through those, the device is being handed
over.

Every boundary is a time the script fixes: a turn opens QUIET_LEAD_IN_MS before
its cluster, closes QUIET_LEAD_OUT_MS after it, and the funscript does not
change while it plays.  The devices walk the same ramps — Nau's driver parks
over the handoff ramp when it takes the device, Genau climbs back out of the
park over the same one — so the picture and the wire share one schedule.

Two disciplines keep the picture still while it slides:

* The stroke is only ever asked WHAT HEIGHT, never WHEN.  A live stroke asked
  *when* something happens — its next floor-touch, its own let-go — answers
  differently every publish, and the picture would move with it.
* Every read is anchored to something that does not move.  The one number that
  cannot be recomputed — the height Genau was at when it let go — arrives
  latched in Genau's own publish (``DriveHud.let_go``), captured at the source
  before the resting phase destroys it.

Shared by every player that hangs the console over a video — Nau's window on
the desktop, FunTimeVR's panel in the headset — so both draw one line by one
set of rules, and free of Pillow, so the shape of the picture is testable
without a window or a font.
