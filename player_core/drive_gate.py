"""What of Genau's publish this video's picture is allowed to believe.

:mod:`player_core.drive_trace` draws one line out of two drivers, and two of
the things it needs cannot be read off a single publish:

*The descent forecasts.*  A descent's top is SELECTED once per approaching turn
and then held, because re-read live every frame it breathed with the beat
between Genau's publish cadence and the frame clock, and the seam flickered.
Holding one means knowing when it is void — and it is void whenever the wave it
was cut from stopped describing this approach: a stint with nothing published,
a different video, a seek, or a pause long enough for the media clock
and the wall clock to part company.

*Who has the device.*  ``DriveHud.let_go`` is Genau's own latch of the height it
handed over at, and it describes the last handoff GENAU made — which, across a
video change while it sits paused, is a handoff from some other video's motion.
A descent drawn from that height tops a ramp the device never made here.  So it
is honored only once Genau has been seen live (``let_go`` unset) within the
current video; until then the descent tops off the parked publish instead, which
is where the device really is.

One gate for every player that hangs the console over a video — Nau's window on
the desktop, FunTimeVR's panel in the headset — so the two hold their forecasts
by the same rules and publish the same touch for the arbiter.  It lived as a
closure and two dicts inside Nau's run loop, where none of these rules could be
exercised: widening the seek window a hundredfold, so a rewind no longer voided
the held forecasts, left the whole suite green.
