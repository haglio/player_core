"""What keeps a player's mpv alive while another thread is inside a call on it.

Every mpv-backed player here is driven from more than one thread, which is
libmpv's designed usage: the client API (property reads, commands, overlays) on
one, the render API on another.  What is never safe is taking the thing away
underneath.  ``mpv_terminate_destroy`` and ``mpv_render_context_free`` both
destroy state a concurrent call is standing on, and python-mpv makes the window
wider still — its ``terminate()`` nulls ``self.handle`` *before* the destroy, so
a property read that began a moment earlier hands libmpv a NULL client and
dereferences it.

That is not a theory.  Closing a player from one thread while a worker read
``time-pos`` from another reproduced an access violation on every attempt, the
faulting thread being the worker at ``mpv_get_property`` (reading 0x48 — NULL
plus a field offset) with the closer inside ``terminate()``.

Shutdown used to rest on ``pump_thread.join(timeout=...)``: a join that times
out returns anyway, and even one that returns cleanly says nothing about the
*other* threads a player is reachable from.  A lease needs no such guess.
Every call into mpv takes one; :meth:`CallGate.close` bars new leases — so a
worker that never noticed the stop flag simply gets no-ops from here on — waits
out the calls already inside, and only then says the handle may be freed.  If
they do not come back inside the timeout it declines to free at all: an mpv
left for the exiting process to reap is a leak, freeing under a live call is a
crash, and a leak at shutdown is much the cheaper of the two.  The wait is
always bounded, so a wedged decoder can never hold a session open.

Leases nest safely (the gate counts callers rather than excluding them), so a
guarded method is free to call another.  What must never take one is ``close``
itself, which would then be waiting for itself.
