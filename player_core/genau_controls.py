"""What Genau's controls can reach, and every verb that moves one.

Genau -- the family's clip player, whatever window or headset it is drawn in --
is spoken to from three places: a verb in ``genau_cmd.txt``, a key in a window,
a press on the console.  Every one of them has to be able to move the same
handful of things: the hand's own state, the cruise stack, the clip advance, the
two flags an orchestrator flips, the clip sequence.

Passing those one at a time is what made adding a control a four-to-six file
edit: a keyword parameter on the dispatcher, another on the refresh controller,
an attribute to store it and a line to hand it on.  They travel together here
instead, built once where the app is wired and handed whole.

Optional means *this build did not wire it* -- a Genau launched without a cruise
stack, a test that only cares about the clip sequence.  A verb whose collaborator
is absent is refused and logged rather than half-acted-on, which is the behavior
:func:`apply_runtime_command` documents.
