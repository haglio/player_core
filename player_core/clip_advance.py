"""How long a clip holds the screen, and the lock that stops it moving at all.

Genau's clips are fractions of a second long, so playing them the way a playlist
plays videos would be a strobe: every clip has to repeat for a while before the
next one arrives.  That "while" is the interval here.  The lock is the same lock
every player in this family has — repeat-one on what is on screen — and it is on
by default, because a held clip is what Genau has always opened on.

There is no separate "auto advance" switch: advancing is simply what an unlocked
Genau does, and the interval is how fast.
