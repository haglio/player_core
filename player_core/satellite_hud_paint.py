"""Draw the satellite's lock HUD as a bitmap mpv composites into the video.

Drawing it into the frame rather than into a window of its own is the whole
point: an mpv overlay has no z-order, so it can neither fall behind the video nor
float above the desktop.

The slab it is drawn on — the rounded translucent panel, the palette, the Segoe
face sized the way Qt sized it, the BGRA hand-off — comes from
:mod:`player_core.hud_panel`, which Nau's own HUD is drawn on too, so the two
players go on looking like one another.  The layout and hit-test rects come from
:mod:`player_core.satellite_hud`, so what is drawn and what is clickable cannot drift apart.
