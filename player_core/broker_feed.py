"""What the broker feeds a clip player: whether it has the room, the beat, the pulse.

The OSR2 broker publishes over UDP.  Three of its verbs are acted on here --
``AUTO`` hands the room to the broker or takes it back, ``BPM`` names the beat
and ``SYNC`` is a downbeat -- and they land in a :class:`BrokerFeed` a reader
thread writes and a frame loop reads, under one lock.  The loop takes a
:func:`snapshot` rather than reading the fields one at a time, so a tick never
sees half of one datagram and half of the next.
