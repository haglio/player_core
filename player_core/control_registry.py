"""How a control is declared, for any player in this family.

A control is one thing a person can move.  This module says what that record
looks like and nothing about what any player's controls are: what a clip
player's are lives in :mod:`player_core.genau_controls`, against its own set of
collaborators, and another player declares its own registry the same way.

The point of the record is that a control is declared once.  Before it, adding
one meant a keyword parameter and a branch in the dispatcher, a parameter and an
attribute and a hand-off line on the tick, and a branch in the key handler --
four to six files for one control, and no way to see from any of them what the
whole control was.
