"""Something in a frame loop failing, said once rather than every frame.

A player's loop runs at up to 120fps and calls the same work again immediately,
so a persistent fault used to write thousands of identical tracebacks a second
into the log -- which both buries the first occurrence and can fill the state
directory the IPC files live in.

The first of each kind is a full traceback, because that is what a reader needs.
Every repeat after it is one debug line with no traceback, and the run of them
is counted; the count goes out when the fault gives way to another or when the
work succeeds again, which are the two moments it means something.

One log can carry more than one of these -- a player's tick and a headset's
frame loop -- so each is named, and says which it is on every line.
