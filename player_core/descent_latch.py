"""Where a trace holds the descents it has already chosen.

:mod:`player_core.drive_trace` chooses, once per approaching turn, how the blue
leaves the device there: the top the gray ramps down from, and the touch-down
it runs to instead when there is one.  WHY it is chosen once and then held, and
what voids it, is :mod:`player_core.drive_gate`'s to say and is said there.

Three readers meet around what is held.  The trace writes it as it paints,
:func:`player_core.drive_gate.next_handoff_touch` reads the chosen touch out of
it to publish for the arbiter, and the gate voids the lot when the wave stops
describing this approach.  They shared a bare dict of anonymous 3-tuples for
that, indexed by position at every one of those sites, one of them into a
tuple inside a tuple; the name of each slot lived only in a comment.  The type
is here instead, so the three say what they mean and there is one place a
fourth would come to.

Holding also means letting go: a session runs for hours and every turn it
approaches leaves an entry in place, so the ones the playhead is long past are
dropped as new ones arrive.
