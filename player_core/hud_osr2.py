"""The device's own line: who has the OSR2, and the controls that aim it.

Every panel whose host drives the device draws this line, so the word for a
parked OSR2 is the same word wherever it is read — the main player's console
(:mod:`player_core.console_hud`) and a HUD over a host that drives it itself
(:mod:`player_core.satellite_hud_paint`) share this one rather than each
spelling the states again.

The controls sit together at the head of the line because they act on the
device rather than on any player: placed by hand rather than through the row
layout, which would read them as different families and open a gap between
them.  The label then hugs its pill, well clear of them, so "OSR2 Robot Hand"
reads as one read-out instead of as another button.
