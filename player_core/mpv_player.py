"""libmpv-backed playback engine, shared by every player in this family.

mpv hardware-decodes on the GPU end-to-end (d3d11va), so it plays HD/4K
smoothly where the old OpenCV-on-the-render-thread pipeline dropped frames.
It also owns audio (A/V sync for free), precise seeking (click-to-seek), and
native A/B looping — so this one object replaces the former VideoStream +
AudioPlayer + PlaybackClock trio.  ``MpvPlayer`` renders directly into a pygame
window the caller owns (via ``wid``); its offscreen twin
(:mod:`player_core.render_player`) renders into a caller-supplied framebuffer
instead, sharing the ``_MpvControl`` surface below.  Overlays go on top through
``overlay_add`` in both.

The interface is deliberately a superset of what any one player needs, because
the two use it differently: Nau plays one file at a time (``loop_file="inf"``)
and navigates explicitly, while a satellite lets end-of-file walk a prefetched
playlist.  The comments below name which caller drives which option — that is
documentation of the two usage patterns, not knowledge the code acts on.  No
method branches on who is calling, and nothing here imports an application.

Not unit-tested: it needs the libmpv DLL and a real window.  The pure control
logic that drives it lives in each app's own session class, tested against a
fake exposing this same interface; Fun Time's hidden-desktop integration suite
exercises the real thing.
