"""The beat the Robot Hand strokes to.

A phase that runs round once per loop at a BPM, and two things that bend it:
the BPM it is told is smoothed into rather than jumped to, and a sync pulse pulls
the phase back onto the downbeat by a fraction of the error.  The phase is what
the stroke is sampled at and what a clip is scrubbed by, so it is the one clock
the hand and the picture share.

Where the beat comes from is the caller's question, and :class:`Beat` is its
answer for one tick.  Under the broker it is a BPM and a pulse published over
UDP and a paused flag read off a file; on its own the hand's speed *is* the BPM
and its stopping *is* the pause.  The four numbers are the same four either way,
which is what lets one engine serve both.

Pure arithmetic: no device, no clock of its own.
