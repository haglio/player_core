"""The file channel, as the players import it.

It lives in :mod:`app_support.file_channel` now: the broker steers by the same
files and is no player, so the calls moved to the one package every repo
installs, and the names of the files themselves are spelled once in
:mod:`app_support.state_files`.  Re-exported here so no player had to change.
