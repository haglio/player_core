"""The drive readout itself — the stroke being sent, drawn.

The block that used to be hand-drawn with ``pygame.draw`` calls straight into
Genau's own layered window, then became a Pillow block on
:mod:`player_core.hud_panel`'s slab, and is now every player's.  Each axis is
one object: its controls, its bar and its number together.  Centre sits down the
left — its number, then a −/+ pair beside the dotted line it moves.  Amplitude
sits down the right — a −/+ pair at the ends of its bar, then its number.  Speed
sits under the trace, out of the way of the other two.

It moved here whole rather than being copied because a second app draws it.
Origenerator floats this over its slideshows, and a Qt repaint of the same
design is not the same picture: it had its own font, its own slab and its own
trace, and read as another app's idea of this one.  So the painter is shared
and the toolkit is not — a caller with no Pillow surface of its own renders
this into one (:class:`player_core.hud_panel.HudPanel`) and blits the result.

It is a block, not a panel: it hosts inside whatever slab is showing it rather
than carrying one of its own, so a console is one HUD and not two stacked.
