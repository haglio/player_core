"""The status file a player publishes for its content source to read.

The reverse leg of :mod:`player_core.file_channel`: commands and the paused flag
go in, this comes back out.  Fun Time polls it to know what each player is
showing — the item on screen, the playhead, whether the player is paused or
holding — and whatever else that player's features need.

Every player leads with the same lines, :class:`PlayerStatus`, written by
:func:`status_fields` and read back by :func:`parse_status`; a player adds its
own lines after them (the main player's loop and funscript, a satellite's
playlist length), and its reader takes those off the same file.

Writes are throttled because the playhead changes every tick, while a poller
only ever samples a few times a second.  *What* to publish arrives as a
``fields`` callable; *how* to publish it — the throttle, the directory, and
surviving a locked or vanished file — is identical everywhere and lives here.
