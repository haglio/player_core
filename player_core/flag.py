"""A boolean two parts of an app share, and the edge that belongs with it.

Two of a clip player's controls are one bit each -- whether the room is paused,
whether the HUD is up -- and each was a one-key mutable dict, a dict whose only
purpose was to let a callee move a caller's variable.  Stringly-keyed, so a typo
in the key was a silent no-op rather than an AttributeError; carrying no
invariant; and threaded through three modules under different key names
("value", "active").

The edge belonged with them.  The HUD's previous value lived on the refresh
controller while the value itself lived in the box, so the two things that have
to be compared were owned by different objects and the comparison could only be
written where both happened to be in scope.
