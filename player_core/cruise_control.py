"""Hands-free variation of the motion — the Robot Hand's cruise control, shared.

It lives beside :mod:`player_core.robot_hand` because the state it varies is
that one's: an app that has the motion gets this with it, rather than growing
its own idea of what "vary it for me" means.

What it hands the device is :mod:`player_core.wave_stack`'s — waves summed, each
with its own travel, center and speed. This is the part with the dice in it. It
decides how many waves there are and how far below the main one the others run,
and then never stops: every ramp has the next one chained on, decided a minute
ahead of the motion's clock, so no dial in the motion is ever simply a number
-- and the readout's picture of what is coming is written once and only slides
into view, never redrawn as a ramp arrives.

Four things it is careful about.

**Every range is pinned to the dials you set.** The speed, the travel and the
center the motion had when this took it over are kept as anchors, and every draw
here is an excursion around one of them rather than a draw from the axis at
large. Nothing accumulates: the tenth minute is drawn from the same ranges as
the first, so an hour of cruising is still recognizably the motion you asked
for, at a pace within sight of the one you set. Only a hand on a dial moves an
anchor, and it moves it by exactly what the hand turned.

**What rides on what.** The first wave *is* the motion: it keeps most of the
travel and runs at the pace the dial names. Every other one runs far slower — a
fifth of it down to a fortieth, measured against the least the main wave runs
while the swell's own ramp lasts — and gets what travel is left, so what it
adds is a swell carrying the whole motion from base to tip and back. A wave at
half the main pace with as much travel is not a swell; it is a second motion
interfering with the first, and that interference is what makes a stack sound
busy while feeling weak — no two swings the same depth, and none of them the
depth you asked for.

**Room to be dramatic.** A ramp that moves a dial five points over twenty
seconds is a ramp nobody can feel. The times here are long and the bands as wide
as being anchored allows: a speed crossing its whole band over half a minute, a
travel closing to two thirds of yours and opening back to all of it, a center
walking as far either way as the swing leaves room for. The motion should be
plainly somewhere different from where it was a minute ago.

**The sum, not the parts.** Every range here is what the *whole* motion is drawn
from, split among the waves — so two waves average what one used to, rather than
piling two full motions on top of each other and sitting the device high and
wide.
