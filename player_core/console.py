"""The controls on the main console, and where they sit.

Fun Time's dashboard used to draw a schematic of the two monitors with a little
box per player, and the main player's box carried these controls.  The player on the
player draws its own HUD now, so they live on it — and whichever player holds the
main slot draws that HUD: Nau in nau and hybrid, Genau in genau mode.  The
console is the same in every mode, so the mode switch and the drive controls do
not move as you flip between them; only the transport changes, because prev/next
step Nau's video in nau/hybrid and Genau's clips in genau.

Kept free of Pillow, like ``satellite.hud`` is, so the rows, the geometry and the
hit-testing are testable without a font.  :mod:`player_core.console_hud` paints them; the
drive readout's own arrows come from :mod:`player_core.drive_readout`.

The action on each button is a Fun Time dashboard command verbatim, because that
is where a press goes: appended to the same command file the dashboard wrote, so
nothing new has to learn what these buttons mean, and Fun Time routes each to the
player the mode says owns it.
