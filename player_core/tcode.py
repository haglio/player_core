"""The T-Code wire format and its UDP transport, shared by every OSR2 driver.

T-Code is the one-line command language the OSR2 broker's UDP inlet accepts
(``L0<pos>I<ms>``: move the linear axis to *pos* over *ms* milliseconds).  Both
driver styles in this family speak it — Genau's phase-driven stroke sender and
the funscript waypoint driver (:mod:`player_core.tcode_driver`) — so the format
and the datagram sink live here, beneath both.  What to send and when stays
with each driver; this module only says it correctly.

# command after taking over asked for its own position in its own ordinary
# interval — a stroke tick, or the gap to the next waypoint — which can be tens
# of milliseconds.  Across a handoff that is most of the travel in a twitch.
# Stretching that first command alone turns the seam into a glide, and every
# command after it is the driver's own again, so nothing else changes.

    ticks thirty times a second — would have its stretched command superseded a
    frame later by an ordinary one, and the device would cover whatever was left
    of the gap in that frame instead.  Flooring the interval for the whole glide
    instead makes each command re-aim at a moving target it is always given
    :data:`HANDOFF_MS` to reach, so the device eases onto the incoming stroke and
    is on it by the time the floor lifts.  A driver that sends sparsely gets the
    same treatment for free.
