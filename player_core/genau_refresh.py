"""One turn of Genau's loop: the clip player's tick.

Everything Genau does each frame, in the order the order matters, against the
collaborators a shell hands it.  The shell -- a pygame window, a headset -- owns
the surface the frame is blitted to and the loop that calls :meth:`refresh`;
what happens inside a turn is the same wherever Genau is drawn.
