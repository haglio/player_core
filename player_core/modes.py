"""The closed sets a player and Fun Time agree on, each as the words on the wire.

Each of these travels between two processes as a bare word in a published file
-- the main console's JSON, the shared state INI, a status file -- and was
compared by literal at every site that read it.  Each entry's value IS that
word: a writer hands the entry to ``json.dumps`` and the word comes out, and
:func:`read_mode` turns the word back into the entry on the way in.

A word a reader does not know is the default, never an error.  The two sides of
every one of these files are separate processes that are not always the same
age, and a player that refused a mode it had not heard of would stop drawing
over a difference of vocabulary.
