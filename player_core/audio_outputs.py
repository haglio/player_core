"""Which sound output a player takes when a session names its device.

A session names the device it wants by a fragment of its name ("Pimax") rather
than by an id, because Windows reissues endpoint ids whenever a device is
re-enumerated.  The catch is that a headset's own software installs outputs
that carry the maker's name too -- a wireless streaming driver, most of them --
so the fragment can name two outputs at once, and taking the first one lands
the sound on the one nothing is listening to.  So the output a real device
answers wins over a driver that answers nothing, and the streaming output is
still taken when it is the only one named.
