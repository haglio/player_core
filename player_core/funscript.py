"""Funscript parsing and the timing questions every scripted player asks of one.

A funscript is a JSON list of (time, position) actions authored against one
video.  Beyond parsing, this answers where sustained action begins (so the OSR2
rests through a long quiet lead-in instead of drifting toward it) and whether a
given playhead sits in a quiet stretch (``is_resting_at`` — what the hybrid
handoff hands to Genau), plus loop-boundary snapping for A-B loops.
