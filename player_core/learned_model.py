"""The learned motion's model: phrases of real swings, and what follows what.

A swing is one movement between two turning points of a script, kept as how
long it took and where it ended.  A phrase is :data:`PHRASE_SWINGS` of them in
a row, cut from a real script, beginning with a swing upward.  Its class is the
pace and the range it mostly keeps, and the model is a library of phrases by
class together with how often each class followed each other class in the
scripts it was trained on.  ``tools/train_learned_motion.py`` builds one;
:mod:`player_core.learned_motion` plays it.
