"""What Genau draws over its clip, and what it says for the console to draw.

Two publications of the drive, on two cadences.  The readout's trace scrolls, so
it cannot wait on a change the way the status file does and is throttled
instead; the console around it -- mode, OSR2, broker -- moves a few times a
minute and is re-read far less often than the readout is rebuilt.  In video
mode the panel belongs to the video player's console, because the controls that
move these numbers are up there, and Genau's window is only the transparent
layer driving the device.
