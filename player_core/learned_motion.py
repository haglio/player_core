"""Motion learned from real scripts -- the Robot Hand's learned mode, shared.

It lives beside :mod:`player_core.cruise_control` and is the other thing that
can take the motion over from the dials.  Where cruise control varies the
waveform, this replaces it: the device follows phrases of real scripting, drawn
one after another from a :mod:`player_core.learned_model`, each phrase joined
to the last where it ended, so the motion is an endless script that no video
was written for.

The dials are the envelope rather than the motion.  Amplitude and center say
the range the phrases play inside, and the speed dial says how many cycles a
minute the motion makes, exactly as it does for the wave: the scripts' own
pace (:attr:`~player_core.learned_model.LearnedModel.native_cycle_ms`) is
scaled to the dial's rate, so a dial at 50 cycles about as often as the wave
does at 50.  Cruise control and this are never on together: switching one on
switches the other off, which :mod:`player_core.genau_controls` sees to.

The motion has a clock of its own, in script seconds: it advances only while
the motion is running, and faster or slower than the wall as the speed dial
says, so a pause freezes it where it stood and a turn of the dial changes the
pace from here on without a step.
