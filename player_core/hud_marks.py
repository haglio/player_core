"""How a HUD control says it wants one of the family's drawn marks.

A console model is a plain description the painter reads -- no colors, no
Pillow -- and that is worth keeping: it is what lets the model be built, tested
and sent around without a drawing toolkit anywhere near it.  So a control that
wants one of :mod:`shared_ui.icon_geometry`'s marks NAMES it, with the marker
below, and the painter is what turns the name into pixels
(:func:`player_core.hud_panel.draw_mark`).

This module holds only the naming, and imports nothing, so both a model module
and a painter can use it without either dragging the other's dependencies along.
