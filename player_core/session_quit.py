"""What a player does when its window is told to close and it is one window of a session.

The close button, Alt+F4, the taskbar's Close, the system menu -- every window
has them, and answered by stopping they take one player out of a live session,
one press at a time, leaving the rest running around a hole nothing refills.  In
a Fun Time session a player is one of several windows the sequencer put up
together, so each of those gestures means what it means on the dashboard's own
window: quit Fun Time.  The ask goes out on the dashboard's channel and the
session comes down as a whole, behind its closing cover, rather than this window
blinking out ahead of the rest.

Nau, Genau and the satellites all said this, in two copies; this is the one.
