"""The satellite lock HUD: the published panel's geometry and hit-testing.

Shared through player_core because two apps draw this exact HUD: each of Fun
Time's satellite players composites it into its video, and a hosted
Origenerator's region shows wear it as a widget — one HUD, one codebase, so
the two surfaces cannot drift apart.

fun_time owns each player's *model* — which clips sit on the map, whether the
satellite is locked, which axis is looping — because only fun_time has the
library metadata.  It serialises that to a small JSON file per player; this module
parses it and lays it out.  (A hosted Origenerator builds its shows' models
directly — the same dataclass, no file in between.)  :mod:`player_core.satellite_hud_paint` turns the layout into a bitmap mpv
composites into the video, so the HUD has no window and therefore no z-order at
all — it *is* the frame.

Kept free of Pillow so the geometry and hit-testing are unit-testable without a
font: the paint module measures text and hands the width back in.
