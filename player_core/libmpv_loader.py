"""Locate the bundled libmpv DLL so ``import mpv`` can find it.

python-mpv resolves libmpv through the Windows DLL search path (``%PATH%``),
not ``os.add_dll_directory``, so the vendored ``vendor/libmpv-2.dll`` must be
on PATH before ``import mpv``.  The DLL is ~117 MB and is NOT committed — it
is fetched locally (see the README) into this repo's ``vendor/``.

Every application that plays video resolves the DLL through this one copy: the
lookup is anchored to the installed package, so an editable install points each
app's venv at the same file instead of each repo vendoring its own.
