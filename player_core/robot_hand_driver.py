"""The Robot Hand put on the wire, and the device changing hands.

The wire format and the UDP sink live in :mod:`player_core.tcode`, beneath every
OSR2 driver in the family; :class:`RobotHandTCodeDriver` is the one that turns
the beat engine's continuous phase into rate-limited position commands, shaped
by the hand's state -- the mirror of :class:`player_core.tcode_driver.FunscriptTCodeDriver`,
which turns a script's waypoints into the same commands.

The hand does not hold the device the whole time.  In video mode a funscript
takes it for every scripted stretch, and an orchestrator's pause takes it too,
so the driver is told on that edge -- :class:`DeviceHandoff` watches for it --
and climbs out of the park when it gets the device back, or latches where the
device was when it loses it.
