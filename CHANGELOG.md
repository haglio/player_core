# Changelog

Dated notes on work that changes what is in this package rather than what it
does. Behaviour-preserving changes are recorded here when they remove a public
name, when they move a number the family is measured by, and when they turn up a
defect that is being left alone rather than fixed.

The comment ratio below is `(radon raw Comments + Multi) / SLOC` over
`player_core/` and `tools/`, the measure `audit/findings/player_core.md` set its
baseline with: **0.7692** over 3,661 SLOC, with 28 of 29 files above 0.25.

## 2026-08-25 — the painters pinned, the unadopted helpers deleted

**Pins.** All seven mutation survivors the audit recorded against this suite are
now killed: the two tooltip-bounds tests, the satellite's reset button, the drive
readout's numbers, the funscript park glide and lead-in boundary, cruise
control's stalled-clock cap, and `adjust_center`'s low edge with `HudClicks`'
double-click window. Each was confirmed by re-running the audit's own mutation in
a throwaway worktree, first against the old test (green, as recorded) and then
against the new one (red).

The audit's suggested fix for the drive readout — asserting `TEXT_PRIMARY` is
absent from the section's set of colours — does not work and was not used: the
values are 8px text, so no pixel of a digit lands on the ink exactly and the
section's brightest pixel with the numbers forced white is 235. The test reads
the number's own pixels instead.

**Deletions.**
