"""The lease that stops a player's mpv being freed under a live call.

The crash this guards is a real one, reproduced on demand: close a player from
one thread while another reads ``time-pos`` and the reader takes an access
violation inside ``mpv_get_property`` — python-mpv's ``terminate()`` nulls its
handle before destroying the core, so the read dereferences NULL.  The shutdown
that let it happen was ``join(timeout=...)`` followed by ``close()``, and a join
that times out returns anyway.

Everything here is the gate's own logic, which needs no libmpv: what the real
handles do once it says "free" is the integration suites' job.
