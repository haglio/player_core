"""Cruise control's waves — the dice, and what they are not allowed to do.

Two techniques are on trial. Waves are summed, so the motion is the pace you set
with a much slower swell of its own size carrying it from base to tip and back;
and every parameter of every wave is a ramp rather than a number, so the motion
is plainly somewhere different from where it was a minute ago. A ramp too small
or too quick to feel is the failure this is tuned against, so the tests here
measure how far things actually move, not merely that they moved.
