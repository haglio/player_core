"""The pin that stands in for a DLL resolved from whatever a feed served that morning.

Two things have to hold or the pin is theatre. A digest that does not match must
stop the fetch rather than be reported and used; and the day upstream retires
the pinned tag -- it keeps about a month -- the fallback has to be loud and still
produce a DLL, because a merge gate that cannot fetch its engine blocks every
landing in the repo that needs it.

Every release, tag and digest here is invented.
