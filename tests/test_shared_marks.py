"""The HUD wears the family's marks, not lookalikes of them.

A HUD is painted into the video frame with Pillow and there is no Qt in a player
process, so for a long time every mark here was whatever a symbol font happened
to carry, or something hand-drawn on the spot.  The bin on this console had
nothing to do with the bin on Origenerator's toolbar.  Both sides now render one
list of geometry out of shared_ui, and these hold the painter to drawing it; the
marks a source names for its buttons are held to it where they are named.
