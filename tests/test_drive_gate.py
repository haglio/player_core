"""What of Genau's publish this video's picture believes, and for how long.

Two things the gate holds across frames: the descent forecasts, chosen once and
held, and whether Genau has been seen live in *this* video yet.

The forecasts are watched through the touch-down the status file publishes —
``handoff_touch`` answers out of the same latch — and the question every case
below asks is the same one: a newer publish has arrived, so is the choice made
for this boundary still the one that was made first, or has it been made again?
Held, the wave underneath can move as much as it likes and the answer does not;
voided, the fresh wave gets to answer.

The stroke used throughout rests its floor ON the park (full amplitude,
centered), because only such a stroke has a touch-down at all; a raised floor
ramps down instead and has none to publish.
