"""Scrubbing the clip with the motion — the picture being *of* the device, and
the cursor only ever going forward.

The frame shown is where the device is: parked shows A, fully retracted shows B,
and a motion that only works part of the axis only shows that part of a half.
The half showing is which way the device is going — front while it retracts,
back while it returns — so a turn short of an end swaps halves and jumps the
cursor forward rather than rewinding, and a full motion plays the whole clip
once.
