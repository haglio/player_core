"""Which flicks get decoded over a session, and which one is on screen while.

`test_flick_selection.py` drives the selection against a fake loader and
`test_flick_loader.py` drives the loader against a hand-filled store.  Between
them sits what the two caches do to each other turn after turn, which neither
can see: a sweep that re-decoded the same two flicks for as long as Genau ran,
and an advance that showed the loading line for a flick it already had.

A decode asked for during a turn comes back at the top of the next one -- the
same one turn of lag the real threads have, without the clock -- so a test can
also step while one is still running, by stepping between turns.
