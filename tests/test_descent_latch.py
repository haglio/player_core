"""The forecasts a trace is holding: one choice per approaching turn.

A descent's top and touch-down are chosen once for the turn they belong to and
then held.  Holding them means having somewhere to hold them, and this is that
place: the three modules that used to pass one bare dict around -- :mod:`player_core.drive_trace` writing it as it paints,
:mod:`player_core.status` reading it as it publishes, :mod:`player_core.drive_gate` voiding it
-- now share a type that names its own fields.

What each held choice MEANS, and when it stops being true, is
:mod:`player_core.drive_trace`'s and :mod:`player_core.drive_gate`'s to say and is tested
there.  Here is only the holding.
