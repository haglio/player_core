"""Which file each picture an offscreen engine draws shows, across a switch of file.

mpv opens the next file while the last one's picture is still up, redraws that
picture along the way, and may hand over one last frame of it after the switch
was asked for; it says it has started the new file at about the moment it hands
over that file's first frame, and a host can draw the frame first.  A host that
wraps a picture by its file -- a headset wrapping a VR video round the viewer --
must never show one file's picture as another's.
