"""The satellite HUD wears the family's marks, not lookalikes of them.

The HUD is painted into the video frame with Pillow and there is no Qt in a
satellite process, so every mark here used to be whatever Segoe UI Symbol
carried -- a bin that had nothing to do with the bin on Origenerator's toolbar,
a loop that was one arc where the family's is a circuit, a reset that was a
counterclockwise arrow and so read as an undo.  They come out of shared_ui's
geometry now, through player_core's HUD chrome, and these hold them to it.
