Each ``--corpus`` folder is searched for ``*.funscript``; a folder holding the
harvester's ``index.jsonl`` also has its topics' tags read, and a script whose
topic wears a tag in ``--skip-tag`` is left out.  What comes out is a

class, drawn evenly from everything seen, and the counts of which class
followed which.  Nothing named in the corpus reaches the model.
