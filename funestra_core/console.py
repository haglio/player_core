"""The controls on the main console, and where they sit.

The Main Funestra draws it, whether Kino or Genau runs on it.  The console is the
same under both, so the mode switch and the drive
controls do not move as you flip between them; only the transport changes,
because prev/next step Kino's video in kino mode and Genau's flicks in genau.

Kept free of Pillow, as :mod:`funestra_core.satellite_hud` is, so the
geometry and the hit-testing are testable without a font.  :mod:`funestra_core.console_hud` paints them; the
drive readout's own arrows come from :mod:`funestra_core.drive_readout`.

The buttons are the source's own (:attr:`ConsoleModel.rows`), each posting its
command verbatim to the command file that source reads; this module places them
and says which one a press landed on.  The one row built here is the one every
source with the OSR2 draws alike, :func:`aim_row`.
