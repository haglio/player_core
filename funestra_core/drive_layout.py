"""Where the drive readout's parts sit, and what a press on one of them asks for.

The readout — the trace of the motion with Centre down its left, Amplitude down
its right and Speed under it — is placed here and painted in
:mod:`funestra_core.drive_readout`. This module draws nothing: it says how big the
block is, where each mark and band lands, which marks are dead at the end of
their range, and what value a press at a point is asking for.

Kept apart from the painter because the halves fail differently. A painter can
be wrong and look wrong; this can be wrong and look right — a hit target that
has drifted a few pixels from the mark over it is invisible until a press lands
on the wrong thing. So it is plain functions over plain numbers, and every panel
showing the readout is a thin painter over one tested layout.
