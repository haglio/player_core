"""The main console — the HUD the Main Funestra draws.

The same console is drawn whether Kino or Genau runs on the Main Funestra: over
Kino's video in kino mode, over Genau's flicks in genau mode.  So the mode switch
and the drive controls keep their places as you flip between modes — only the
transport changes, because it steps Kino's video in one and Genau's flicks in the other.

Its top block is Kino's own answer to "what am I playing?" — the status line (the
length mode, or the compilation and your place in it) beside the active-Funestra
dot, with the file on screen as a muted line under it, the same shape each
satellite's HUD leads with.  Both are empty in genau mode, where there is no Kino
playlist backing the screen.  Everything else is the console the orchestrator
publishes (:mod:`funestra_core.console`) plus the Robot Hand's drive readout
(:mod:`funestra_core.drive_readout`) with its own controls.

The wording and shape are pure functions; the drawing goes onto the slab
:mod:`funestra_core.hud_panel` owns, the same slab the satellites' HUD is drawn on,
so every Funestra says things the same way and from the same corner.
