"""The verbs a content source sends a player, spelled once.

A player is driven by whoever has content for it -- Fun Time's dispatcher
today -- through a queue of these on its command file
(:mod:`funestra_core.file_channel`).  Each player declares the ones it answers
in a registry (:mod:`funestra_core.control_registry`) and refuses the rest; the
spellings live here so a sender and every receiver read them off one line,
which is what stopped one player saying LOCK for the hold another called
LOCK_ON.

A verb about the player's own surface rather than about its content -- a
headset's projection, the Robot Hand's motion -- is that player's own and is
spelled beside its registry.
